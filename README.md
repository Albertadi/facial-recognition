# Facial Emotion Recognition
## Overview
This repository contains a facial emotion recognition system that leverages three machine learning models—Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Residual Networks (ResNets), and VGG16—to predict one of seven emotions from facial images:
- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Surprise
- Neutral

The system is integrated with your device’s webcam, allowing real-time emotion detection based on facial expressions.

## Running real-time emotion detection
G23_FaceRecognition.ipynb is meant to be run within Google Colab. Read description from "Test with our own image".
