# Facial Emotion Recognition
## Overview
This repository contains a facial emotion recognition system that leverages three machine learning models—k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (Gaussian NB), and Random Forest—to predict one of seven emotions from facial images:
- Anger
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happiness
- Sadness
- Surprise
- Neutral
The system is integrated with your device’s webcam, allowing real-time emotion detection based on facial expressions.
